               <p class="title">Sept.9th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">I knew this might sound crazy, but I couldn't stop writing this diary. I was diagnosed with Kleine-Levin syndrome, a rare syndrome that occurs during teenagers, and patients would fall asleep without realizing how low they sleep; it may last for days or months with no curing methods. It was weird for a genetic clone like me. I should be perfect, both human and product. My brain is capable of massive functioning, and I was designed to serve the family. But today, it felt like my soul was floating out of my body. I saw my mom crying outside the medical room, and I had never seen her cry before. My father was arguing with the doctor, and I could only read a few words from his mouth. It said, "return," "nonfunctioning," and "waste of money." And I decided to say nothing.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="title">Sept.10th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">My mom saw my diary today, she asked me why I documented the file in a prehistoric way, and I told her I did not trust my mind anymore. I asked her if anything was wrong with me, and she answered nothing. I was left alone in this medical room. It was painted pale, with the smell of disinfectant fluid. I opened the computer inside my mind and illegally linked the hospitals' wifi, and I didn't want to be traced. I closed my eyes and prepared for the connection, and the record claimed that I slept for 20 days. I supposed that was why my father was angry with me. My family was considered dominant, everyone in that house represented wealth and power, and I assumed my absence disobeyed the family rule.</p>

               <p class="title">Oct.15th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">It was bored laying on the bed. I was functioning normally for the entire month, and I could go home the following week. I researched the company that produced me; they were sponsored by my father,  located on another planet, I couldn't trace them.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="title">Oct.18th. 2099</p>
               <p class="text">I was back home, but things changed. My father took a phone call today. He stared at me angrily and slapped the door on my face. He didn't want me there. I went upstairs, so my mom prepared some biscuits, orange flavor, my favorite. She was about to talk, but she didn't. She left the door behind and told me she would like to read me a story, Alice in Wonderland. She stopped me from searching that up, so I didn't. It was a story I couldn't understand; why would the Mad hat fall in love with Alice? And a raven doesn't look like a writing desk. My mom used to explain a lot, but these days she doesn't. Does she love me? I couldn't figure it out.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="title">Oct.19th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">A private conversation was made between my parents earlier today. They argued about medications and fees and the space project. My father said I was a monster; I hacked into the classified document, my project. He thought I was no longer part of the family, and their plans moving to space should catch up.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="title">Dec.24th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">It was Christmas Eve, and my mom said there was a place she wanted to bring me. She looked sorrowful, I asked her if I behaved wrong, and she shook her head. I didn't believe it, and this was the first time I had disobeyed her. I said I didn't want to leave, and I saw my father step out of the living room; he said everything was ready. I had to go.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="title">Dec.25th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">We arrived at a town at the edge of the planet, surrounded by forests. My father told me there was a wood cabin inside the woods, and I assumed that's where I live, not we. We walked across the town, about a few minutes, I achieved to the end, there's no we anymore, I was alone, with the key to the cabin, and a map of the planet. There's an area blocked from the map, and I guessed it was the forbidden area. I have to arrive at the cabin before the sun goes down. The house is small, with a basket of orange flavor biscuits and a Dormancy tank. I suspect it was the place to rest and support my life. There's a structural machine next to the tank, and it has words written on it, VI-2100, the newest version droid; I saw it in the database. Maybe my family left it here, and they would probably come and fetch it up.</p> 
               <br>
               <p class="title">Dec.26th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">No one came today, and my syndrome didn't show up since that day. What is wrong with being curious? Why did my parents abandon me? I couldn't figure it out.</p>
               <br>
               <p class="title">Dec.27th.2099</p>
               <p class="text">Today, I went to the town and bought myself a writing desk; it didn't look like a raven but is suitable for writing diaries. There's no sign of waking VI-2100 up, and I decided to call it V, for short.</p>
